Code and Data used for conducting Research on my Masters thesis : Indoor 3D Reconstruction from a Single Image

For basic code structure, repository from https://github.com/NVlabs/planercnn is used. On top of that we provide addtioonal modules for loss functions, utility functions for analysing 3D and 2D data s well as for visual evaluation of depth maps, point clouds and 3D models.
