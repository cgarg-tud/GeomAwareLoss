# GeomAwareLoss
Code and Data used for conducting Research on my Masters thesis : Indoor 3D Reconstruction from a Single Image

For basic code structure, repository from https://github.com/NVlabs/planercnn is used. On top of that we provide additional modules for loss functions, utility functions for analysing 3D and 2D data s well as for visual evaluation of depth maps, point clouds and 3D models.

Input Data : Scannet Dataset Please sign the terms of use as provided by scannet to access test dataset

Training and Testing : For using our loss function, use for loss module

3D Reconstruction : For normal consistency use depth_recons function in the modules
